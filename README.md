# QameleO
QameleO (Quality of Air Module for Environmental Learning Engineering and Observation) is an environmental measurement station for air quality. It was developed since 2018 by the CoFab in Bondy and two research teams at the Research Institute for Development in Bondy and the University of Burgundy in Dijon (UMI 209 UMMISCO and UMR CNRS 6282 BIOGEOSCIENCES).

This new device is based on (i) low-cost technology making it possible to plan for a network deployment of measurements; (ii) it now has sensors to simultaneously measure the 3 size fractions of particulate pollution (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1), as well as temperature and humidity; (iii) the measurements are calibrated with an original method, thus allowing scientific use.
